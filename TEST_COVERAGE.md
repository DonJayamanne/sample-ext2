# Test Coverage Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive test suite added to the sample-ext VS Code extension.

## Test Files Overview

### 1. `extension.test.ts` - Core Extension Tests
- **Extension Activation Tests**
  - Verifies `activate` function exists and is callable
  - Verifies `deactivate` function exists and is callable
  - Tests extension activation with mock context
  - Validates command registration during activation

- **Command Tests**
  - Checks if `sample-ext.helloWorld` command is available
  - Tests command execution without errors

- **Extension Deactivation Tests**
  - Ensures deactivation doesn't throw errors

### 2. `commands.test.ts` - Command-Specific Tests
- **Command Registration**
  - Validates all expected commands are registered
  - Checks command naming conventions
  - Ensures commands don't contain invalid characters

- **Command Execution**
  - Tests command execution without errors
  - Verifies commands are available in command palette

### 3. `integration.test.ts` - Integration and Environment Tests
- **VS Code Environment**
  - Validates VS Code API availability
  - Tests extension context structure
  - Verifies required properties are present

- **Extension Configuration**
  - Tests extension configuration validity
  - Checks activation event handling

- **Error Handling**
  - Tests handling of invalid commands
  - Validates error responses for malformed inputs

- **Extension Lifecycle**
  - Tests multiple activation scenarios
  - Ensures proper subscription management

### 4. `edge-cases.test.ts` - Edge Cases and Stress Tests
- **Command Parameter Testing**
  - Tests commands with undefined arguments
  - Tests commands with null arguments
  - Tests commands with various object types

- **Boundary Value Testing**
  - Tests extremely long command names
  - Tests command names with special characters

- **Type Safety Testing**
  - Tests different argument types (string, number, boolean, array, object)
  - Validates proper error handling for type mismatches

- **Concurrency Testing**
  - Tests multiple simultaneous command executions
  - Tests rapid sequential command executions

- **Memory and Performance Testing**
  - Basic memory leak detection
  - Performance boundary testing

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Files**: 4
- **Test Suites**: 15+
- **Individual Tests**: 25+
- **Coverage Areas**:
  - Extension lifecycle (activation/deactivation)
  - Command registration and execution
  - Error handling
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions
  - Type safety
  - Concurrency
  - Memory management

## Running Tests

```bash
# Compile tests
npm run compile-tests

# Run all tests (requires VS Code test environment)
npm test

# Compile everything including tests
npm run compile
```

## Test Structure

All tests follow the Mocha testing framework structure:
- `suite()` for grouping related tests
- `test()` for individual test cases
- `assert.*` for assertions
- Proper mocking of VS Code extension context

## Notes

- Tests are designed to work with VS Code's test runner
- Mock objects are created for extension context to simulate real environment
- Tests validate both positive and negative scenarios
- Edge cases include boundary values, type safety, and error conditions
